# Keystone SDK

Build as part of the top-level [Keystone](https://github.com/keystone-enclave/keystone)

## Build options

See the Makefile for current build options. These will modify both how
libraries are built, as well as the Eyrie runtime.

After changing options, we suggest `make clean` in the sdk directory,
and then a top-level Keystone build.
